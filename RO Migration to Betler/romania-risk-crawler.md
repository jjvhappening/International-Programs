# Romania Risk Crawler (PLYRTPM-33)

## Objective
Build a weekly automated routine that scans across Jira, Slack, and CPR sources to identify topics that are at risk or generating high discussion, then surfaces findings as a Slack digest to `#ro-migration-risks` and auto-comments on stale Jira issues.

---

## Phase 0 — Load tools (run once at session start)

Before any data collection begins, load all required tool schemas in two batches. Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all tools are confirmed loaded.

```
ToolSearch: select:mcp__b846195e-69b9-4ade-88d4-18e6a3f23890__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql,mcp__b846195e-69b9-4ade-88d4-18e6a3f23890__getJiraIssue,mcp__b846195e-69b9-4ade-88d4-18e6a3f23890__addCommentToJiraIssue,mcp__b846195e-69b9-4ade-88d4-18e6a3f23890__getTransitionsForJiraIssue,mcp__b846195e-69b9-4ade-88d4-18e6a3f23890__transitionJiraIssue,mcp__b846195e-69b9-4ade-88d4-18e6a3f23890__editJiraIssue
```

```
ToolSearch: select:mcp__3da07a3d-3738-4c02-999f-340a5e731aae__notion-fetch,mcp__3da07a3d-3738-4c02-999f-340a5e731aae__notion-query-data-sources,mcp__3da07a3d-3738-4c02-999f-340a5e731aae__notion-update-page,mcp__3da07a3d-3738-4c02-999f-340a5e731aae__notion-create-pages,mcp__95268b0a-2ab0-44e0-9a74-e956c9f0dc3b__slack_send_message,mcp__95268b0a-2ab0-44e0-9a74-e956c9f0dc3b__slack_read_thread,mcp__95268b0a-2ab0-44e0-9a74-e956c9f0dc3b__slack_search_public_and_private
```

Also read these reference files before Phase 1 to avoid runtime lookup round-trips:
- Notion schema: `C:\Users\JonVince\Documents\GitHub\International-Programs\RO Migration to Betler\references\notion-risk-register-schema.md`
- Slack channel IDs: `C:\Users\JonVince\Documents\GitHub\International-Programs\RO Migration to Betler\references\slack-channels.md`
- Risk register: `C:\Users\JonVince\Documents\GitHub\International-Programs\RO Migration to Betler\risk-register.json`

## Signal Logic

### 1. Jira signals

Field IDs from [Jira Roadmap Logic v2](../../Jira%20Data%20Quality/references/Jira%20Roadmap%20Logic%20v2.md).

| Signal | Field / Definition | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Health Status = Red | `customfield_12111` value contains `"off track"` (e.g. `"🔴 Off Track"`) | 4 |
| Health Status = Amber | `customfield_12111` value contains `"at risk"` (e.g. `"🟡 At Risk"`) | 2 |
| Flagged | Issue has the Jira "flagged" marker | 3 |
| Blocked / at-risk | Status = Blocked, or label includes `at-risk` | 3 |
| Short Status Update contains risk language | `customfield_14447` contains "blocked" / "at risk" / "delayed" / "dependency" | 2 |
| Stale — in delivery | Status in (In Planning, In Delivery, In Production) with no comment or field update in **7 days** | 2 |
| `is blocked by` dependency flagged | Linked issue (via Jira issue links) is Blocked, flagged, or stale | 2 |
| Planned Release Date overdue — backlog (genuine risk) | `customfield_12114` past AND all child epics are in Backlog / To Do (work not yet started) | 3 |
| Planned Release Date overdue — in progress (data quality) | `customfield_12114` past AND at least one child epic is actively In Progress / In Delivery | 0 ¹ |
| *Planned Release Date slipped (rows below)* | *Scored only when all child epics are in Backlog / To Do — see [Epic Context Check](#epic-context-check). If any epic is In Progress / In Delivery, score 0 regardless of slip magnitude.* | — |
| Planned Release Date slipped — <1 week | Date changed vs prior run AND prior date was ≤7 days away | 4 |
| Planned Release Date slipped — <2 weeks | Date changed vs prior run AND prior date was 8–14 days away | 3 |
| Planned Release Date slipped — <3 weeks | Date changed vs prior run AND prior date was 15–21 days away | 2 |
| Planned Release Date slipped — <4 weeks | Date changed vs prior run AND prior date was 22–28 days away | 1 |
| Planned Release Date slipped — 4+ weeks | Date changed vs prior run AND prior date was >28 days away | 1 |
| Planned Release Date slipped — epics in progress (no score) | Date changed vs prior run AND at least one child epic is In Progress / In Delivery | 0 ¹ |
| Stale — pre-delivery | Status in (To Do, In Discovery, In Definition) with no update in **14 days** | 1 |
| Stale — backlog | Backlog with no update in **30 days** and activity detected in Slack/CPR | 1 |
| Health Status missing (in-delivery) | `customfield_12111` empty for initiative in Tier 4 status | 1 |
| Missing required fields | Planned Release Date (`customfield_12114`) or other Tier 4 required fields absent | 1 |
| No Jira data, external signal | Topic in Slack/CPR with no matching initiative found, or initiative with no description/comments | 1 |

> ¹ Score 0 — data quality signal only. Record in register as DQ; do not score as programme risk. See Epic Context Check below.

> **Planned Release Date overdue / slipped** — always uses `customfield_12114`, never the native Jira `duedate`. Classification (genuine risk vs data quality) is determined by the Epic Context Check below. **Slip detection**: compare `customfield_12114` against `planned_release_date` stored from the prior run; weights per table above. Inward pulls (date moved earlier) are noted but not scored. The `planned_release_date` field in the register is updated to the current value only after the full scoring pass completes — never incrementally — so a partial-run failure leaves all prior-run values intact for the next run.

> Status tier definitions follow the PLAYER status workflow: Pre-Delivery (Backlog → Awaiting Approval), Delivery (Awaiting Delivery → In Production), Post-Delivery (Rollout / Experimentation → In Cleanup). See Jira Roadmap Logic v2 for full workflow reference.

---

### Epic Context Check

Triggered for any initiative where the Planned Release Date (`customfield_12114`) has passed but the initiative is still in a delivery status. The crawler fetches all child epics of the initiative and classifies the signal:

**CRITICAL**: Fetch and examine EVERY child epic via JQL before classifying. A partial list can produce a wrong classification — do not classify until all epics are retrieved. Apply in priority order:

| Priority | Epic state | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | One or more child epics In Progress / In Delivery (regardless of others) | `in_progress_overdue` — **data quality** | Score 0 for risk; delivery is underway — date needs updating but this is DQ, not risk |
| 2 | ALL child epics Done or Won't Do — zero exceptions, every epic checked | `not_closed_out` — **data quality** | Score 0 for risk; flag as DQ; stamp `ro-not-closed-out` label on PLAYER initiatives |
| 3 | Mix of Done/Won't Do + Backlog/To Do (some complete, some not yet started, none In Progress) | `partial_delivery` — **data quality** | Score 0 for risk; record as DQ; partial completion with unstarted work remaining |
| 4 | All child epics in Backlog / To Do (none started, none Done) | `backlog_overdue` — **genuine risk** | Apply `release_date_overdue` signal at full weight (3); treat as timeline risk |
| 5 | No child epics found | `no_epic_data` — **insufficient data** | Apply signal at weight 1; flag for investigation |

**Data quality issues** (`not_closed_out`, `in_progress_overdue`, `partial_delivery`) are written to the risk register with `category = "data_quality"` and surfaced in the 🗂 DQ section of the digest. They do not contribute to risk severity scoring and do not appear in the Escalated or Top 3 sections. Staleness signals on a DQ-category entry are still scored independently (a stale DQ entry still needs attention).

**SSU false positive guard:** if the Short Status Update contains risk-language keywords (blocked, at risk, delayed) but the phrase is preceded by a negation within 3 words (e.g. "no blockers", "not blocked", "not at risk"), the SSU signal is suppressed for that initiative.

### 2. Slack signals
| Signal | Definition | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Risk emoji | Message contains ⚠️, 🚨, or the word "risk" / "blocked" / "escalate" | 2 |
| High discussion | Thread with **5+ replies in the last 7 days** | 3 |
| Unresolved thread | Thread older than 3 days with no resolution marker (e.g. ✅) | 2 |
| Single mention | Any message referencing an in-scope initiative name (minimum threshold) | 1 |

### 3. CPR signals (via Notion)

Signals from **structured databases** (Player, Social, Sports) carry full weight. Signals from **unstructured pages** (Fraud Prevention, Multichannel, Transact, Engagement, Onboarding/Identity) carry reduced weight — Jira cross-referencing is still attempted but matches are flagged as low-confidence.

| Signal | Source type | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| CPR Health = at-risk | Structured DB (Social) — direct `CPR Health` field | 3 |
| Recurring topic (2+ consecutive meetings) | Structured DB | 3 |
| Recurring topic (2+ consecutive meetings) | Unstructured pages | 1 |
| No resolution noted on agenda item | Structured DB | 2 |
| No resolution noted on agenda item | Unstructured pages | 1 |
| Single CPR mention | Any | 1 |

---

## Workstreams

Risks are grouped for digest and rollup by the Jira board of the linked initiative. Current program workstreams:

| Workstream | Jira Board | Initiatives (as of 2026-05-01) | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| International Programs | IP | 113 | Main program delivery board — all feature/capability deliverables for the RO migration |
| Player | PLAYER | 75 | Player product initiatives tagged to the program — cross-audited by the Jira Data Quality workflow |
| Gaming | GAM | 5 | Gaming integrations — SB RO integrations, game provider integrations |
| Data & Analytics | DAP | 4 | Data migration, CRM data, analytics re-platforming |
| Platform | PLT | 2 | Platform-level initiatives supporting the migration |
| Social | SOC | 1 | Social product initiative tagged to the program |

External dependencies (e.g. Betler platform, payment providers, regulatory bodies) are not tracked via the crawler — they are added manually to the Notion risk register.

---

## Cross-Reference Logic
- **Jira stale + Slack active**: Jira issue has no update in 7 days BUT the topic is being actively discussed in Slack → **high priority flag** (data is out of date vs reality)
- **Slack risk signal + no Jira issue**: Something flagged in Slack with no corresponding Jira tracking → **create/flag for manual review**
- **CPR recurring + Jira not progressed**: Topic raised in multiple CPRs but Jira status unchanged → **escalation candidate**

---

## Dependency Inference

When two or more in-scope initiatives appear together in the same evidence — same Slack thread, same CPR agenda item, or an explicit dependency phrase connecting them — the crawler assesses whether a formal Jira link is missing and should be suggested.

### High confidence threshold

A suggestion is only surfaced when **all** of the following are true:

1. **Co-occurrence signal**: both initiative names appear in the same Slack thread OR the same CPR agenda item (same-channel-only does not qualify)
2. **No existing link**: Jira confirms no `is blocked by`, `blocks`, or `relates to` link already exists between the two initiatives
3. **Claude confirms**: Claude assesses the pair — given their summaries, categories, and the shared signal context — and concludes a dependency relationship is plausible with high confidence (explicit reasoning required; vague topical overlap does not qualify)

Suggestions that do not meet all three criteria are discarded silently — they do not appear in the digest or the register.

### Confidence boosters (any one raises confidence further)

- Explicit dependency language in the co-occurrence signal: "waiting for", "blocked by", "depends on", "before X we need Y", "can't proceed until"
- One initiative is stale while the other has active Slack discussion — suggesting one is waiting on the other
- Both initiatives share the same Product Lead or Engineering Lead

### Suggested dependency object (stored in `suggested_dependencies` in JSON)

```json
{
  "id": "SD-001",
  "initiative_a": "IP-45",
  "initiative_b": "IP-62",
  "suggested_link": "IP-45 is blocked by IP-62",
  "confidence_reason": "Both named in same #ro-ip-temp thread (2026-04-28): 'wallet must be live before registration can complete'",
  "first_suggested": "ISO date",
  "times_suggested": 1,
  "status": "pending",
  "dismissed_by": null
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `suggested_link` | Proposed Jira link direction — always phrased as "A is blocked by B" or "A blocks B" |
| `confidence_reason` | Quoted evidence: the specific thread, message, or CPR item that triggered the suggestion |
| `times_suggested` | Number of runs this pair has co-occurred; re-suggested after 3 runs of new evidence even if previously dismissed |
| `status` | `pending` / `accepted` / `dismissed` |
| `dismissed_by` | Name of person who dismissed (Jon, Niels, or an initiative lead) |

### In the digest

Suggestions appear in a dedicated section, clearly separated from confirmed risks:

```
🔗 *Suggested dependencies — review required*
• SD-001: IP-45 → IP-62
  "wallet must be live before registration can complete" — #ro-ip-temp (28 Apr)
  Suggested link: IP-45 is blocked by IP-62 | Accept (create Jira link) or Dismiss
```

Accepted suggestions are not acted on automatically — the programme lead creates the Jira link manually. On the next run the crawler picks up the formal link and handles it through normal dependency tracking.

**Linking rules:**
- Every `RR-NNN` ID is hyperlinked to its Notion page: `<https://app.notion.com/p/[notion_page_id_no_dashes]|RR-NNN>`. If `notion_page_id` is null (risk not yet synced), render as plain `RR-NNN`.
- Every Jira issue key is hyperlinked: `<https://axilis.atlassian.net/browse/[KEY]|KEY>`.
- The header Notion link always points to the full register: `https://app.notion.com/p/9dab74b2885b4f8f93aa73dad97ea6da`.
- Suggested dependency IDs (SD-NNN) are not separately linked — the Jira keys within each suggestion are already linked.
- **Slack thread evidence**: when a risk has entries in `slack_threads`, append each as `<url|🧵>` immediately after the signal tag that the thread supports (e.g. after `Slack unresolved` or `Slack (N🧵)`). If multiple threads, chain them: `<url1|🧵> <url2|🧵>`. Thread URLs are read directly from `slack_threads[].url` in the JSON register — no Slack API call is needed at digest time.

**Digest rules:**
- Header is a single line: date, open count, H/M/L breakdown, resolved count, Notion link.
- Sections use emoji + bold heading inline — no separator bars.
- **One line per risk.** Signals abbreviated as tags: `Health🔴`, `Health🟡`, `SSU`, `Slack (N🧵)`, `CPR`, `Stale`, `Overdue`, `DateSlip`, `No Jira`. Omit tags not triggered.
- `💬` appended at the end of any risk line where `comments_posted` contains an entry with `run_number` equal to the current run. Omit if no entry for this run exists.
- `📅 Nd` only shown when Planned Release Date (`customfield_12114`) is set and within 60 days. Negative values shown as `📅 -Nd overdue`.
- `🛠 [status]` appended when `mitigation_status` is `planned` or `in_progress`.
- Trend prefix: `🆕` for `new_this_run = true`; `↑` / `→` / `↓` for recurring risks.
- **Escalated section** always shown; if none, render as `🚨 *Escalated* — none`.
- **Top 5** shows highest-scoring non-Escalated risks; `_+N more in Notion_` when total open > 5 + escalated count.
- **Resolved section** omitted entirely if no risks resolved this run.
- **DQ section** omitted entirely if no `data_quality` category entries are open this run (covers `not_closed_out`, `in_progress_overdue`, and `partial_delivery` classifications).
- **Suggested dependencies** section omitted if `suggested_dependencies` array is empty.
- Workstream summary always shown on one line; use `—` for workstreams with zero risks.

### B. Auto-comment on Jira issues

**Trigger rules — all require at least one corroborating external signal. Staleness alone never triggers a comment.**

| Trigger | Condition |
|---|---|
| Stale + external signal | Initiative is stale (7+ days in delivery, 14+ days pre-delivery) AND has a Slack thread or CPR mention this run |
| SSU risk language | SSU contains explicit risk keywords (blocked / at risk / delayed) — negation guard applied |
| No Jira match | External signal (Slack or CPR) references an in-scope topic but no matching initiative found — triage request |

**False positive guards:**
- Staleness alone → scored only, never commented
- SSU with negation within 3 words ("no blockers", "not at risk") → suppressed
- Health Status = Green with no external signal → no comment regardless of staleness

Comment template:
```
🤖 *[Initiative summary — one short sentence describing what this initiative delivers]*

Could you drop a quick update on the Short Status Update field? We're missing [specific field(s) — e.g. a status update / a planned release date] for this one.

We track RO Migration initiative health weekly — keeping this field current helps the programme team stay on top of any blockers early. Thanks!
```

**Template rules:**
- Line 1: one sentence stating what **this specific initiative** delivers — taken from the Jira summary of the issue being commented on. Do not copy the ticket title verbatim if it is cryptic; rephrase plainly.
- Line 2: name the specific field(s) that triggered the signal for **this issue** (e.g. "a status update", "a planned release date", "a health status"). Do not list signal codes or weights.
- Line 3: fixed closing line — always the same, friendly, not passive-aggressive.
- **Never reference other Jira keys in the comment body.** If a risk entry covers multiple initiatives (e.g. a grouped risk like RR-015), each auto-comment is scoped entirely to the initiative it is posted on. The recipient has no context for other tickets and cross-referencing them is confusing.
- Do not use words like "flagged", "risk scan", "stale", "overdue", or "no update in X days" — these read as accusatory.
- Do not comment on the same issue more than once per run.

## Implementation Approach

This will be built as a **Claude Code scheduled routine** using the `schedule` skill, running weekly.

### Sub-agent architecture

The crawl uses three parallel sub-agents for data collection. All raw API payloads, intermediate tool responses, and per-signal reasoning are contained within sub-agent context windows — none reach the main session. The main session handles register management and synthesis only.

**Launch sequence**

1. Main session: Step 1a — load register, read Notion suppressed flags
2. Main session: launch **Jira collector** and **Notion collector** sub-agents in parallel
3. Main session: when Jira collector completes (name index written to disk), launch **Slack collector** sub-agent
4. Main session: when all three sub-agents complete, read their output files and run Steps 6–8

**Sub-agent responsibilities**

| Sub-agent | Steps | Writes to disk |
|---|---|---|
| Jira collector | 1, 1b, 1c, 1d | `references/jira-signals-temp.json`, `references/jira-name-index-temp.json` |
| Notion collector | 5 | `references/notion-signals-temp.json` |
| Slack collector | 2, 4, 4b | `references/slack-signals-temp.json`; also edits `references/slack-channels.md` in-place via Step 4b |

**Sub-agent inputs (pass in prompt)**
- All three: `run_number`, `last_run_date`, absolute path to `risk-register.json` (sub-agents read prior state for slip detection and the one-comment-per-run guard)
- Slack collector only: absolute path to `references/jira-name-index-temp.json` (written by Jira collector; used to match Slack topic mentions to initiative keys)

**Sub-agent output file format**

```json
{
  "run_number": 12,
  "generated": "ISO datetime",
  "signals": [
    {
      "key": "IP-45",
      "sources": ["jira"],
      "signals": ["stale_7d", "health_red"],
      "score_contribution": 6,
      "days_to_release": 18,
      "planned_release_date": "2026-06-01",
      "product_lead": "Jane Smith",
      "engineering_lead": "John Doe",
      "epic_context": { "classification": "backlog_overdue", "active_epics": [], "done_epics": 3, "wont_do_epics": 0 },
      "slack_threads": [],
      "label_actions": [],
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

**Temp file lifecycle**: temp files are overwritten at the start of each run and are not persisted between runs. Before consuming a temp file, check that `run_number` matches the current run — if it does not, the sub-agent failed silently and the main session must abort and re-launch that sub-agent.

### Context management

The sub-agent architecture is the primary protection against context saturation — raw API payloads never reach the main session. Within each sub-agent:

- Discard raw API payloads immediately after field extraction. Never retain the full JSON response in the sub-agent's context.
- For Jira responses > 50k characters: extract key, summary, status, updated, and relevant custom fields using PowerShell `ConvertFrom-Json` into a reduced array before processing in-context.
- At the end of processing, write the output file to disk and return a one-line summary only (e.g. `"Jira collector complete: 200 initiatives scanned, 14 signals written to jira-signals-temp.json"`). The full signal list travels via the output file, not via the return value — this keeps the main session's context footprint proportional to the number of signals, not the volume of raw data.

### Steps to build:
1a. **Load risk register** — read `risk-register.json` at the start of each run (create empty register if first run). For every risk where `notion_page_id` is set, read the Notion `Suppressed` checkbox and update `suppressed` in the JSON before scoring begins — this ensures suppressed risks are excluded from scoring, auto-comments, and digest output from the very first step.
1. **Define Jira scope query** — fetch all in-scope initiatives across all boards using: `issuetype = Initiative AND cf[14342] = "🇷🇴 Romania migration" AND status NOT IN (Backlog, "Won't Do")`. **Request only these fields** (pass as `fields` parameter to avoid full-payload responses): `key,summary,status,updated,parent,customfield_12111,customfield_14447,customfield_12114,customfield_12121,customfield_12122,issuelinks,created,priority`. **Must paginate** — results exceed 100 (200 total as of 2026-05-01); fetch pages until `isLast = true`. Build a name index (`{ initiative_name → key, board, status }`) for Slack cross-referencing. Discard raw response after building the index. PLYRTPM is not in scope — do not query it. Immediately write the name index to `references/jira-name-index-temp.json` in this format: `{ "run_number": N, "generated": "ISO datetime", "index": { "KEY": { "summary": "...", "board": "...", "status": "..." } } }`. Clear the name index from in-context memory — all subsequent initiative lookups within this sub-agent read from the file on demand rather than scanning the full in-memory object.
> **Health field — confirmed field ID and value format (Run 15):** `customfield_12111` is correct and returns data when explicitly requested. Value format is emoji-prefixed: `"🟢 On Track"`, `"🟡 At Risk"`, `"🔴 Off Track"`. Signal matching must check for `"on track"` / `"at risk"` / `"off track"` (case-insensitive) — do NOT check for `"green"` / `"amber"` / `"red"`, those strings do not appear in the values. If health signals appear absent in a run, verify the `fields` parameter includes `customfield_12111` — ad-hoc extraction scripts in prior runs probed `customfield_14343`/`14344` which do not exist on these issues.

1b. **Resolve blockers** — for each initiative that has an `is blocked by` issue link, fetch the blocking issue with `fields=key,summary,status,project,customfield_12121,customfield_12122,customfield_14342,updated`. Determine `in_program_scope` by checking whether `customfield_14342` contains option ID `17894`. Calculate `days_blocked` from the link creation date. Set `stale = true` if `updated` is more than 7 days ago. Apply the elevated signal weight (4) for out-of-scope stale blockers.
1c. **Epic context check** — for any initiative whose release date (`customfield_12114`) has passed and which is still in a delivery status, fetch all child epics using JQL: `issueType = Epic AND parent = [initiative key]` with `fields=key,status`. Classify using the five classifications defined in the Epic Context Check table: `backlog_overdue`, `in_progress_overdue`, `not_closed_out`, `partial_delivery`, or `no_epic_data`. Apply the `release_date_overdue` signal only for `backlog_overdue` (weight 3) and `no_epic_data` (weight 1). Score 0 for all other classifications — route to DQ tracking instead. Epic fetches are per-initiative (Jira JQL does not support a single bulk parent-IN call for child epics). Fire these in parallel up to the Jira API rate limit — the overdue subset is typically small.
1d. **Stamp DQ labels** — for every initiative classified as `not_closed_out` in Step 1c, stamp the label `ro-not-closed-out` via `editJiraIssue` (add to labels array; do not overwrite other existing labels). In the same step, query Jira for any PLAYER initiative that currently carries this label but was NOT classified as `not_closed_out` this run — remove the label from those. This keeps the label set accurate mid-week even before the DQ workflow clears everything at end of its run.
2. **Build Slack channel discovery** — dynamically find all channels with `romania` or `ip` in their name (including private/temp) via Slack MCP. Runs in parallel with Steps 1 and 4+5.
3. **Build signal evaluator** — logic module that scores each topic across all three sources
4. **Build Slack scanner** — reads discovered channels, identifies high-discussion/risk threads; for Slack-only topics, attempts to match to a Jira initiative using the name index at `references/jira-name-index-temp.json` and includes the key if found. **Scan priority**: (1) read `references/slack-channels.md` and scan all known channels first using a **7-day** message window; (2) for channels returned by Step 2 that are NOT in the reference file, scan with a **24-hour** window only — new channels get a lighter first pass until confirmed high-signal. This prevents unknown channels from expanding the context footprint on first encounter.
4b. **Sync channel reference** — runs immediately after Step 4 completes, using the per-channel activity data captured during the scan. Three operations, all using targeted Edit calls on `references/slack-channels.md`:
  1. **Add new channels**: for any channel returned by Step 2 discovery that is not already in the reference file, append a new row with `last_active` set to today's date and a brief description inferred from the channel name.
  2. **Refresh active channels**: for any channel where at least one message was read during the Step 4 scan, update its `last_active` date to today.
  3. **Prune stale channels**: for any channel in the reference file where `last_active` is 30+ days before today AND no messages were found during the Step 4 scan, remove that row entirely. Do not prune channels whose `last_active` is unknown (`—`) — leave them for the next run to assess.
  Do not rewrite the whole file — only touch rows that changed. Log any pruned channels in the run notes.
5. **Build CPR scanner** — queries Notion for recent CPR meeting note pages, extracts unresolved/recurring agenda items. Runs in parallel with Steps 1 and 2.
6. **Merge and cross-reference** — main session reads `references/jira-signals-temp.json`, `references/slack-signals-temp.json`, and `references/notion-signals-temp.json`. Verify `run_number` in each file matches the current run before merging — abort if any file is missing or stale. Merge all signal arrays by initiative key (union sources, union signals, sum score_contribution). Flag cross-source discrepancies: Jira stale but Slack active → high priority; Slack risk signal but no Jira issue found → triage request.
6a. **Score and upsert risks** — for each detected topic: (1) skip if `suppressed = true`; (2) check `comments_posted` — if an entry exists with `run_number` equal to the current run, skip auto-comment for this issue (one-comment-per-run guard); (3) accumulate signal weights + cross-source bonus → raw score; (4) apply timeline proximity amplifier using `customfield_12114`; (5) derive severity; (6) infer category from signal pattern; (7) pull `product_lead` and `engineering_lead` from `customfield_12121`/`customfield_12122` on the linked initiative; (8) calculate `days_to_release`; (9) set `trend` by comparing to `score_last_run`; (10) set `new_this_run`; (11) upsert into JSON register.

**Scoring output format — compact table, no prose per risk.** Produce a single table covering all risks scored this run:

```
| ID     | score | final | sev | trend | signals_added         | notes_update                              |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|-------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| RR-011 | 6     | 9.0   | H   | ↑     | stale_7d, health_red  |                                           |
| RR-019 | 4     | 6.0   | H   | →     | slack_hr              | SSU "blocked by wallet" → likely PLT-330  |
| RR-041 | 3     | 4.5   | M   | 🆕    | cpr_recurring         |                                           |
```

- `score` = raw signal total; `final` = amplified score
- `signals_added` = only signal codes newly triggered this run (delta vs prior run — omit codes already present in prior `signals[]`)
- `notes_update` = one-line free-text for any inference that doesn't fit a signal code — this is what gets written to the `notes` field in the register. Leave blank if nothing to note.
- No per-risk narrative paragraphs. All reasoning must be captured in `signals_added` or `notes_update` — if it cannot fit there, it is not needed downstream.
6a-write. **Write state checkpoint** — immediately after Step 6a completes (all risks scored), persist changes to `risk-register.json` using **targeted Edit calls only** — never a full-file Write. Do not wait until after Notion sync or Slack digest. This ensures scored state is preserved even if the session runs out of context before later steps complete.

**How to write:**
1. Build a change list: compare each risk's current in-memory state to what was in the register at load time. Only include risks whose fields actually changed this run (`score`, `score_last_run`, `trend`, `severity`, `status`, `signals`, `slack_threads`, `days_to_release`, `occurrences`, `last_seen`, `consecutive_misses`, `new_this_run`, `notes`, `suppressed`, `planned_release_date`, `epic_context`).
2. For each **changed existing risk**: use a targeted Edit call. The `old_string` must be the entire JSON object for that risk (from `{` to `}` including surrounding comma/whitespace as it appears on disk). The `new_string` is the updated version of that same object. One Edit call per risk.
3. For each **new risk** (not present in the register at load time): append it to the `risks` array with a targeted Edit — find the closing `]` of the array and insert before it.
4. Update `last_run` and `run_number` in the header block via a single targeted Edit.
5. **Exception — first run only**: if the register was empty or did not exist at load time, a full Write is acceptable since there is no prior state to diff against.

**Second checkpoint (after Step 6b):** once Notion sync is complete, use the same targeted-Edit approach to write back any `notion_page_id` values that were set during Step 6b. Do not rewrite the whole file — only the risks whose `notion_page_id` changed from null to a real value.
6b. **Notion sync** — for any risk with severity = High OR occurrences >= 2, create or update the corresponding page in the "RO Migration Risk Register" Notion database; store `notion_page_id` in JSON to avoid duplicates
6c. **Mark resolved risks** — any risk in the JSON register that was NOT detected this run: increment `consecutive_misses`; at 1 miss set status = Resolved in Notion; at 2 misses set status = Closed and archive in JSON
6d. **Dependency inference** — identify all pairs of in-scope initiatives that co-occurred in the same Slack thread or CPR agenda item this run. For each pair: (1) confirm no existing Jira link via `issuelinks`; (2) pass to Claude with initiative summaries, categories, signal patterns, and the verbatim co-occurrence evidence — ask Claude to assess whether a dependency is plausible and in which direction, with explicit reasoning; (3) only proceed if Claude returns high confidence. Check the `suggested_dependencies` register — if this pair was previously dismissed, only re-surface if `times_suggested` has incremented 3+ times since dismissal. Upsert into `suggested_dependencies` in the JSON register.
7. **Digest formatter** — reads severity from register; prepends risk ID (e.g. `RR-001`) to each bullet; promotes Escalated risks to the 🚨 section; produces the Slack message with @mentions for Jon and Niels
8. **Auto-commenter** — posts to stale/flagged Jira issues
9. **Schedule** — register as a Monday 09:00 GMT routine
10. **Git commit and push** — after digest is posted, run:
    ```bash
    git add "RO Migration to Betler/risk-register.json"
    # also stage if Step 4b made changes:
    git add "references/slack-channels.md"
    git commit -m "chore(risk-crawler): Run N (YYYY-MM-DD) — [N] risks, [N] escalations"
    git push origin main
    ```
    Stage only `risk-register.json` and `references/slack-channels.md`. Do not stage helper scripts, temp files, or `.pkl` artifacts. The exact command `git push origin main` is required — the auto-mode classifier blocks the push unless this specific command appears in the task definition.

### Open decisions to confirm before build:
- [x] Niels De Winde's Slack handle — confirmed `U04MM3C1H8U`
- [x] Initiative count — confirmed 200 initiatives across 6 boards (IP, PLAYER, GAM, DAP, PLT, SOC); query must paginate
- [ ] Notion risk register parent page — confirmed: https://app.notion.com/p/superbet/e03b4e84b51e40089f6663e9f14576b3

## Staleness Thresholds (proposed — to be confirmed)
| Issue state | Stale after |
|---|---|
| In Progress | 7 days no update |
| To Do / Backlog (with external signal) | 14 days |
| Backlog (no external signal) | 30 days |

---

## Risk Register

Persisted between runs as `risk-register.json` in this directory. Each detected topic is stored as a risk entry and updated on every crawler run.

| `blockers` | Array of blocker objects (populated for Dependency category risks only — see Dependency Handling) |

---

## Dependency Handling

When an in-scope initiative has an `is blocked by` Jira link, the crawler fetches the blocking issue and enriches the risk entry with full context. This applies regardless of whether the blocker is inside or outside the Romania migration program.

### What is fetched per blocker
| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `key` | Blocker issue key |
| `summary` | Blocker issue title |
| `status` | Current Jira status of the blocker |
| `project` | Project board the blocker belongs to |
| `in_program_scope` | Whether the blocker has program tag `17894` (🇷🇴 Romania migration) |
| `product_lead` | `customfield_12121` on the blocker, if set |
| `engineering_lead` | `customfield_12122` on the blocker, if set |
| `days_blocked` | Days since the `is blocked by` link was created |
| `stale` | True if the blocker has had no update in 7+ days |

### In-scope vs out-of-scope blockers

| Blocker type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **In-scope** (`in_program_scope = true`) | Owned within the program — surfaced as a dependency risk, programme lead can action directly |
| **Out-of-scope** (`in_program_scope = false`) | Owned by another team — surfaced with a distinct ⛔ marker in the digest, indicating cross-team escalation is required |

### Blocker signal weight adjustment

If a blocker is out-of-scope AND stale, the dependency signal weight increases from 2 to **4** — an external team owning a stale blocker on an in-scope initiative is treated as a high-priority risk regardless of other signals.

### In the digest

Dependency risks display a blocker sub-line beneath the main risk bullet:
```
• [RR-007] ↑ *IP-45: Reality check* — Dependency | PL: Jane Smith, EL: John Doe
  ⛔ Blocked by: TRANSACT-123 (Payment platform upgrade) — out-of-program | EL: Alex Jones | stale 21d
  📅 12 days to release · Week 3
```

If an initiative has multiple blockers, each is listed on its own sub-line. Out-of-scope blockers always appear before in-scope blockers.

### In the digest — dedicated section for out-of-scope blockers

All out-of-scope blockers are additionally aggregated into a standalone section at the end of the digest, giving the programme lead a single view of everything requiring cross-team action:
```
⛔ *Cross-team dependencies requiring action*
• IP-45 blocked by TRANSACT-123 (Alex Jones) — stale 21d · 📅 12 days to release
• IP-62 blocked by WALLET-88 (no EL set) — stale 9d
```

---

## DQ Integration — Player Data Quality Workflow

When the Epic Context Check classifies an initiative as `not_closed_out`, the crawler stamps the Jira label `ro-not-closed-out` on that initiative. This signals to the Player Jira Data Quality workflow (which runs the same week) that the initiative needs closing out.

The DQ workflow reads this label, appends a note to the relevant squad's Slack message, then removes all `ro-not-closed-out` labels from PLAYER initiatives at end of its run. This ensures labels are always fresh: re-stamped by the crawler each Monday, cleared by the DQ workflow the same week.

---

## Risk Categories

Every risk is assigned a category at detection time. The crawler infers the most likely category from signal patterns; it can be corrected manually in the Notion register.

| Category | Description | Typical signals |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical** | Implementation blocker, integration failure, platform instability | Jira blocked/flagged, Slack technical discussion, Health Status Red |
| **Dependency** | Blocked on another team, initiative, or initiative link | Jira `is blocked by` link, stale initiative with active upstream discussion |
| **Resource** | Capacity gap, staffing issue, skills shortage | Slack discussion about team bandwidth, stale initiative with no Engineering Lead set |
| **Scope** | Requirements unclear or changing, initiative not well-defined | Missing PRD/description, CPR recurring without resolution, Slack scoping discussions |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory, legal, or data privacy constraint | Compliance-related initiative keywords, CPR items without decision |
| **Timeline** | Delivery date at risk, schedule slippage | Planned Release Date proximity + Health Status Amber/Red, stale in-delivery initiative |

---

## Scoring Logic

### Step 1 — Raw signal score

Each detected signal carries a weight (defined in the Signal Logic tables above). Scores accumulate across all sources for a given risk in a single run. A cross-source bonus of **+2** applies whenever signals from 2 or more sources contribute to the same risk.

### Step 2 — Timeline proximity amplifier

If the linked initiative has a Planned Release Date (`customfield_12114`) set, the raw score is multiplied by:

| Days to Planned Release Date | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| ≤ 14 days | ×2.0 |
| 15–30 days | ×1.5 |
| 31–60 days | ×1.25 |
| > 60 days or no date set | ×1.0 |

### Step 3 — Severity threshold

| Amplified score | Severity |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | **Low** — on radar, no immediate action |
| 3–5 | **Medium** — warrants monitoring |
| 6+ | **High** — requires active attention |

Severity is re-calculated fresh each run from live signals. Historical recurrence is tracked separately via `occurrences` and drives the Escalated lifecycle state independently. The raw (pre-amplification) score is stored in `score` for trend comparison across runs.

### Impact (auto-calculated)
| Condition | Impact |
|---|---|
| Linked Jira issue priority = Critical or High | **High** |
| Linked Jira issue priority = Medium, or 10+ Slack replies | **Medium** |
| Linked Jira issue priority = Low, or no Jira issue found | **Low** (default) |

---

## Notion Sync

A dedicated Notion database **"RO Migration Risk Register"** is created in the same Notion space as the CPR databases.

**Sync criteria:** only risks with `severity = high` OR `occurrences >= 2` are synced. Low-confidence, first-seen Medium/Low risks remain JSON-only until they recur.

**Suppression sync:** the `Suppressed` checkbox is read at Step 1a (register load), not after sync — see Step 1a above. After writing risk property updates in Step 6b, write back any `suppressed` state changes discovered during the run (i.e. a risk un-suppressed mid-run). The "Suppressed By" text field is updated alongside. This allows programme leads to suppress or un-suppress risks directly from Notion without touching the JSON.

**Database schema:**
| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| Risk ID | Title |
| Description | Text |
| Category | Select: Technical / Dependency / Resource / Scope / Compliance / Timeline |
| Severity | Select: High / Medium / Low |
| Impact | Select: High / Medium / Low |
| Trend | Select: Worsening ↑ / Stable → / Improving ↓ |
| Status | Select: Open / Monitoring / Escalated / Resolved / Closed / Suppressed |
| Workstream | Select: IP / GAM / DAP |
| Sources | Multi-select: Jira / Slack / CPR |
| Linked Jira Issues | Text (comma-separated keys) |
| Product Lead | Text |
| Engineering Lead | Text |
| Days to Release | Number |
| First Seen | Date |
| Last Seen | Date |
| Occurrences | Number |
| Mitigation Action | Text |
| Mitigation Owner | Text |
| Mitigation Target Date | Date |
| Mitigation Status | Select: None / Planned / In Progress / Complete |
| Suppressed | Checkbox — when checked: excludes the risk from the Slack digest entirely and blocks all Jira auto-comments for this risk. The crawler reads this field on each run and syncs it back to `suppressed = true` in the JSON register. |
| Suppressed By | Text |
| Blockers | Text (one line per blocker: key · summary · owner · days blocked) |
| Out-of-Program Blocker | Checkbox — true if any blocker is outside the Romania migration program |
| Max Days Blocked | Number — longest active blocker duration in days |

On first sync the returned Notion page ID is stored in `notion_page_id` in the JSON so subsequent runs update the existing page rather than creating a duplicate. Suppressed risks are synced with Status = Suppressed and excluded from all digest outputs.

---

## Risk Lifecycle

| Status | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Open** | First detected this run | Add to JSON register; set `new_this_run = true`; `trend = stable` (no prior score to compare) |
| **Monitoring** | Detected in a subsequent run | Increment `occurrences`; calculate trend vs `score_last_run`; sync to Notion if severity = High or `occurrences >= 2` |
| **Escalated** | `occurrences >= 3` OR cross-source High for 2+ consecutive runs | Set status = Escalated; update Notion; promote to 🚨 section in digest |
| **Resolved** | Not detected for 1 run | `consecutive_misses = 1`; update Notion status to Resolved; include in digest as resolved this week |
| **Closed** | Not detected for 2 consecutive runs | `consecutive_misses = 2`; update Notion status to Closed; remove from active digest |
| **Suppressed** | Manually set by Jon, Niels, or initiative Product/Engineering Lead | Set `suppressed = true`, record `suppressed_by`; exclude from all scoring and digest outputs; sync suppressed status to Notion |

### Mitigation tracking

When a mitigation is underway, `mitigation_status` progresses through: `none → planned → in_progress → complete`. Setting `mitigation_status = complete` does not automatically close a risk — the crawler still checks for live signals. The risk closes naturally once signals are no longer detected for 2 consecutive runs.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm Niels De Winde's Slack user ID (needed for @mention in digest)
2. Build and test signal logic against a known at-risk issue
3. Schedule routine
4. Update PLYRTPM-33 with this plan as description
